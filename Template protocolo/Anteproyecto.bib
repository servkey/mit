abstract = {This review summarizes empirical research on the management of virtual teams, i.e., distributed work teams whose members predominantly communicate and coordinate their work via electronic media (e-mail, telephone, video-conference, etc.). Instead of considering virtual teams as qualitatively distinct from conventional teams, the degree of "virtuality" of teams is understood as a dimensional attribute. This review is guided by a lifecycle model in which five phases are distinguished in the management of teams with high virtuality: Preparation, launch, performance management, team development, and disbanding. The main focus of the review is on quantitative research with existing virtual teams in organizational contexts. However, experimental research and case studies are considered when no field studies are available. The major research results are summarized for human resource management tasks within these phases, and recommendations for practitioners are derived. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The Eclipse platform presents an opportunity to openly collaborate and share visualization tools amongst the research community and with developers. In this paper, we present our own experiences of "plugging-in" our visualization tool, SHriMP Views, into this environment. The Eclipse platform's Java Development Tools (JDT) and CVS plug-ins provide us with invaluable information on software artifacts relieving us from the burden of creating this functionality from scratch. This allows us to focus our efforts on the quality of our visualizations and, as our tool is now part of a full-featured Java IDE, gives us greater opportunities to evaluate our visualizations. The integration process required us to re-think some of our tool's architecture, strengthening its ability to be plugged into other environments. We step through a real-life scenario, using our newly integrated tool to aid us in merging of two branches of source code. Finally we detail some of the issues we have encountered in this integration and provide recommendations for other developers of visualization tools considering integration with the Eclipse platform.

abstract = {In !arge projects, soflware developers struggle with two sources of complexity - the complexity of the code itself, and the complexity of the process of producing it. Both of these concerns have been subjected to considerable research investigation, and tools and techniques have been developed to help manage them. However, these solutions have generally been developed independently, making it difficult to deal with problems that inherently span both dimensions. We describe Augur, a visualization tool that supports distributed soflware development processes. Augur creates visual representations of both soflware artifacts and soflware development activities, and, crucially, allows developers to explore the relationship between them. Augur is designed not for managers, but for the developers participating in the soflware development process. We discuss some of the early results of informal evaluation with open source soflware developers. Our experiences to date suggest that combining views of artifacts and activities is both meaningful and valuable to soflware developers.},

abstract = {Awareness to users is a valuable feature of a collaborative system. Therefore, the designers of a system of this type may find it useful to receive hints on the awareness support provided by the system when it is under development or evolution. This paper proposes a tool for their use to obtain suggestions on the awareness features provided by the system and those not currently supported by it. The considered kinds of awareness were obtained from a review of a significant number of proposals from the literature. The tool is based on a checklist of design elements related to these awareness types to be applied by the application designer. The construction of this checklist was done as follows. The process started with an analysis of the types of awareness to be provided. This step ended with 54 selected design elements and six awareness types. Experts on the development of collaborative systems used their experience to provide correlations between the design elements and the types of awareness previously identified, thus encapsulating their expertise within the checklist. The proposal was applied to three existing collaborative systems and the results are presented. The obtained results suggest that the checklist is adequate to provide helpful hints that may be used to improve an application's awareness support. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses challenges for developers while using groupware applications. To understand the problems encountered by groupware applications, it is essential to realize that most interest in groupware development is found among the developers and users of commercial off-the-shelf products who previously focused exclusively on single-user applications. In addition to technical challenges, groupware poses a fundamental problem for product developers: Because individuals interact with a groupware application, it has all the interface design challenges of single-user applications, supplemented by a host of new challenges arising from its direct involvement in group processes. A groupware application never provides precisely the same benefit to every group member. Costs and benefits depend on preferences, prior experience, roles, and assignments. Although a groupware application is expected to provide a collective benefit, some people must adjust more than others. Ideally, each individual benefits, even if they do not benefit equally. Most groupware requires some people to do additional work to enter or process information required or produced by the application.},

Mckinlay, 1986), a presentation tool for 2D graphics, to three dimensions. While Vista's primary function is to automatically generate an effective visualization technique design for a given data set, it also allows users to interactively modify this design and renders the resulting image using a variety of rendering algorithms.},

abstract = {Metadata is of paramount importance for persons, organizations, and endeavors of every dimension that are increasingly turning to the World Wide Web (here- after referred to as the Web) as a chief conduit for ac- cessing and disseminating information. This is evidenced by the development and implementation of metadata schemas supporting projects ranging from restricted cor- porate Intranets, data warehouses, and consumer-oriented electronic commerce enterprises—to freely accessible di- gital libraries, educational initiatives, virtual museums, and other public websites. Today's metadata activities are unprecedented because they extend beyond the tradi- tional library environment in an effort to deal with the Web's exponential growth. This article considers metadata in today's Web environment. The article defines metadata, examines the relationship between metadata and cataloging, provides definitions for key metadata vocabulary terms, and ex- plores the topic of metadata generation. Metadata is an extensive and expanding subject that is prevalent in many environments. For practical reasons, this article has elec- ted to concentrate on the information resource domain, which is defined by electronic textual documents, graph- ical images, archival materials, museum artifacts, and other objects found in both digital and physical infor- mation centers (e.g., libraries, museums, record centers, archives, etc.). To show the extent and larger applica- tion of metadata, examples are also drawn from the news channel, data warehouse, electronic commerce, open source, and medical communities.a METADATA},

En esta comunicaci{\'{o}}n, se definen las modalidades de interacci{\'{o}}n grupal, se caracterizan cinco tipos de asociados a las awareness de modalidades de interacci{\'{o}}n definidas, y se plantean los requerimientos de los tipos de awareness introducidos. Palabras clave: Awareness, modalidades de interacci{\'{o}}n grupal, requerimientos de tipos de awareness. 1. Introducci{\'{o}}n En un espacio de trabajo virtual, los miembros del grupo que lo utilizan para interactuar trabajan de forma conjunta y colaborativa [Rodr{\'{i}}guez et al., 2009, 2010]. Ese trabajo en grupo no es simplemente la uni{\'{o}}n de tareas individuales si no es un conjunto de actividades coherentes con buenas estrategias de comunicaci{\'{o}}n, cooperaci{\'{o}}n y coordinaci{\'{o}}n entre los miembros del grupo. Para crear este tipo de estrategias los miembros del grupo tienen que estar al tanto sobre el estado y cambios en el espacio de trabajo y las acciones que otros miembros del grupo est{\'{a}}n realizando, este tipo de informaci{\'{o}}n se conoce como " Informaci{\'{o}}n Awareness " [Herrera et al., 2013]. Entre las definiciones de awareness se se{\~{n}}alan de inter{\'{e}}s las siguientes: [Gallardo et al., 2011] se define awareness como el conocimiento en detalle de las interacciones de otros participantes con el espacio de trabajo compartido {\'{o}} en el {\'{a}}mbito grupal se refiere al conocimiento de los roles y responsabilidades de los otros participantes. Estas definiciones implican que todos los participantes necesitan informaci{\'{o}}n de awareness acerca de los otros integrantes, todo el tiempo, sin embargo sabemos que algunos participantes necesitan mas awareness que otros dependiendo de sus roles. Tampoco incluye la idea que la informaci{\'{o}}n de awareness este basada seg{\'{u}}n los roles de cada participante. Es importante mencionar que en el contexto de CSCL (Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning) se enfatiza en el an{\'{a}}lisis de interacciones para el soporte de roles y la necesidad de adaptar la informaci{\'{o}}n a los diferentes roles que participan en un entorno CSCL [Marcos-Garc{\'{i}}a, 2012]. En este contexto en esta comunicaci{\'{o}}n se introduce el marco te{\'{o}}rico (secci{\'{o}}n 2) definen las modalidades de interacci{\'{o}}n grupal (secci{\'{o}}n 3), se caracterizan cinco tipos de asociados a las awareness de modalidades de interacci{\'{o}}n (secci{\'{o}}n 4), y se plantean los requerimientos de los tipos de awareness introducidos (secci{\'{o}}n 5), y se presentan reflexiones preliminares de los resultados en el contexto de la l{\'{i}}nea de trabajo (secci{\'{o}}n 6).},

abstract = {Visualization typically involves large computational tasks, often performed on supercomputers. The results of these tasks are usually analyzed by a design team consisting of several members. Our goal is to depart from traditional single-user systems and build a low-cost scientific visualization environment that enables computer-supported cooperative work in the distributed setting. A synchronously conferenced collaborative visualization environment would let multiple users on a network of workstations and supercomputers share large data sets, simultaneously view visualizations of the data, and interact with multiple views while varying parameters. Such an environment would support collaboration in both the problem-solving phase and the review phase of design tasks. In this article we describe two distributed visualization algorithms and the facilities that enable collaborative visualization. These are all implemented on top of the distribution and collaboration mechanisms of an environment called Shastra, executing on a set of low-cost networked workstations},

abstract = {A well-known problem with the adoption of groupware systems is that people do not think it's worth participating in them unless a sizable group of people are already doing so. Thus, the lack of a critical mass of users is often a barrier to starting these systems. People will also stop using a groupware-or computer-supported cooperative work system if participation falls below a certain level. This threshhold effect can be quite sudden, and it can kill a group-communication system. At the other extreme, people are attracted to systems having considerable activity-the activity itself excites and motivates people. In short, people pay more attention when they know other people are paying attention. We have repeatedly encountered these situations in our own work. Our experiences led us to consider what user-interface mechanisms could provide a motivating sense of social activity. We developed social activity indicators to show how much and what kind of activity is going on in groupware systems. This article describes three types of indicators we have built. As distributed applications, such as concurrent engineering or business-process systems. become even more prevalent, it will be important to consider the interface requirements for making these systems socially usable and useful},

In addition, we present the results of an experimental study with 30 users aimed to evaluate the social interactions of a GS (a collaborative videogame-First Person Shooter).

These dependencies create a need for communication and coordination that requires continuous effort by developers. Empirical studies, including our own, suggest that technical dependencies among software components create social dependencies among the software developers implementing those components. Based on this observation, we developed Ariadne, a plug-in for Eclipse. Ariadne analyzes software projects for dependencies and collects authorship information about projects relying on configuration management repositories. Ariadne can "translate" technical dependencies among components into social dependencies among developers. We have created visualizations to convey dependency information and the presence of coordination problems identified in our previous work. We believe the information conveyed in the visualizations will prove useful for software developers. 2007 ACM.},

abstract = {Software developers have been recently interested in building next generation groupware systems that provide environments adaptable to various contexts of users, thus, offering information and services in a timely way depending on the developed activity. However, the existing solutions for building such systems are mostly limited to modeling and representing individual indicators, neglecting the importance of the social indicators. By contrast, in this paper we present a mechanism for designing and measuring an indicator called Social Presence (SP), which allows to represent the relevance of users when they are gradually participating in a collaborative activity. Thus, teams of users can be supported for decision-making with an indicator that mostly reflects teamwork and not only individual work. In order to propose this mechanism, we designed an algorithm to measure social presence from the results of the objectives and tasks associated to a collaborative activity. For evaluating this algorithm, we implemented an experiment with 24 users, which allowed us to obtain a dataset with team information from a groupware called AssaultCube - a collaborative First-Person-Shooter type videogame. The obtained results evidence that performance measurement on teams can still be improved.},

In fact, as the taxonomic analysis in the paper will show, many of the techniques share similar operating steps that can easily be reused.

In UNIX, the Revision Control System (RCS) or the Source Code Control System (SCCS) is used in general as a version control tool. However, they (1) lack the ability to explicitly display version changes; (2) require complicated commands to be typed; and (3) lack the ability to manage multiple files and modules. This paper proposes a solution for these issues by applying 3D visualization. A prototype system called VRCS (Visual RCS) was developed, in which each piece of version information stored in an RCS history file is displayed as a 2D tree by taking the z-axis as time. Other 2D trees are laid out in 3D space in the same way. In our visualization, files which compose a certain release of the software are connected by a line called a relation-link. By using GUIs, users can check in/out each version easily and interactively. More importantly, just by choosing the relation-link, a certain release is rebuilt automatically},

This isolation is both good and bad It is good, because developers make their changes without any interference from changes made concurrently by other developers. It is bad, because not knowing which artifacts are changing in parallel regularly leads to problems when changes are promoted from workspaces into a central configuration management repository. Overcoming the bad isolation, while retaining the good isolation, is a matter of raising awareness among developers, an issue traditionally ignored by the discipline of configuration management. To fill this void, we have developed Palantir, a novel workspace awareness tool that complements existing configuration management systems by providing developers with insight into other workspaces. In particular, the tool informs a developer of which other developers change which other artifacts, calculates a simple measure of severity of those changes, and graphically displays the information in a configurable and generally non-obtrusive manner. To illustrate the use of Palantir, we demonstrate how it integrates with two representative configuration management systems.},

El modelo propuesto de awareness permite promover la concientizaci�n, comunicaci�n, colaboraci�n y coordinaci�n en el CSCL de ALLEGRO. El modelo faculta a los aprendices a tener una percepci�n de lo que los dem�s hacen dentro del CSCL con el prop�sito de que les sirva para su entorno y actividades de trabajo. El aprendiz toma un papel activo en su proceso formativo a trav�s de actividades que le permiten exponer e intercambiar ideas y opiniones con los dem�s integrantes, convirtiendo de esta forma el aula en un foro abierto a la reflexi�n y al contraste critico de pareceres y opiniones. Se puede concluir que el modelo es un valioso recurso desde los puntos de vista tecnol�gico y pedag�gico; en este �ltimo, en su fundamentaci�n convergen diversas teor�as, algunas de ellas antag�nicas.},

abstract = {Awareness of individual and group activities is critical to successful collaboration and is commonly supported in CSCW systems by active, information generation mechanisms separate from the shared workspace. These mechanisms penalise information providers, presuppose relevance to the recipient, and make access difficult. We discuss a study of shared editor use which suggests that awareness information provided and exploited through the shared workspace, smoothly between close and loose collaboration, passively allows users to move and to assign and coordinate work dynamically. Passive awareness mechanisms promise effective support for collaboration requiring this sort of behaviour, whilst avoiding problems with active approaches.},

abstract = {Collaborative visualization is a study field that emerged by combining computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and information visualization. The main goal is to analyze how visualization techniques can be used to support collaboration. One of the key aspects for the effective use of visual representations as a facilitator for collaboration is the analysis of how this feature influences collaborative work The aim of this paper is to present a study which considered the use of visualization techniques for supporting the collaboration process from a 3C collaboration model perspective. More specifically, we analyzed the influence of techniques from the user's perspective. A case study was conducted to investigate the relationship of visualization techniques with activities performed by users in a software development scenario. The results of the case study show that visualization techniques influence collaborative tasks.},

abstract = {In !arge projects, soflware developers struggle with two sources of complexity - the complexity of the code itself, and the complexity of the process of producing it. Both of these concerns have been subjected to considerable research investigation, and tools and techniques have been developed to help manage them. However, these solutions have generally been developed independently, making it difficult to deal with problems that inherently span both dimensions. We describe Augur, a visualization tool that supports distributed soflware development processes. Augur creates visual representations of both soflware artifacts and soflware development activities, and, crucially, allows developers to explore the relationship between them. Augur is designed not for managers, but for the developers participating in the soflware development process. We discuss some of the early results of informal evaluation with open source soflware developers. Our experiences to date suggest that combining views of artifacts and activities is both meaningful and valuable to soflware developers.},

abstract = {Metadata is of paramount importance for persons, organizations, and endeavors of every dimension that are increasingly turning to the World Wide Web (here- after referred to as the Web) as a chief conduit for ac- cessing and disseminating information. This is evidenced by the development and implementation of metadata schemas supporting projects ranging from restricted cor- porate Intranets, data warehouses, and consumer-oriented electronic commerce enterprises—to freely accessible di- gital libraries, educational initiatives, virtual museums, and other public websites. Today's metadata activities are unprecedented because they extend beyond the tradi- tional library environment in an effort to deal with the Web's exponential growth. This article considers metadata in today's Web environment. The article defines metadata, examines the relationship between metadata and cataloging, provides definitions for key metadata vocabulary terms, and ex- plores the topic of metadata generation. Metadata is an extensive and expanding subject that is prevalent in many environments. For practical reasons, this article has elec- ted to concentrate on the information resource domain, which is defined by electronic textual documents, graph- ical images, archival materials, museum artifacts, and other objects found in both digital and physical infor- mation centers (e.g., libraries, museums, record centers, archives, etc.). To show the extent and larger applica- tion of metadata, examples are also drawn from the news channel, data warehouse, electronic commerce, open source, and medical communities.a METADATA},

abstract = {Although teamwork has been identified as an essential skill for Computer Science (CS) graduates, these skills are identified as lacking by industry employers, which suggests a need for more proactive measures to teach and assess teamwork. In one CS course, students worked in teams to create a wiki solution to problem-based questions. Through a case-study approach, we test a developed teamwork framework, using manual content analysis and sentiment analysis, to determine if the framework can provide insight into students' teamwork behavior and to determine if the wiki task encouraged students to collaborate, share knowledge, and self-adopt teamwork roles. Analysis revealed the identification of both active and cohesive teams, disengaged students, and particular roles and behaviors that were lacking. Furthermore, sentiment analysis revealed that teams moved through positive and negative emotions over the course of developing their solution, toward satisfaction. The findings demonstrate the value of the detailed analysis of online teamwork. However, we propose the need for automated measures that provide real-time feedback to assist educators in the fair and efficient assessment of teamwork. We present a prototype system and recommendations, based on our analysis, for automated teamwork analysis tools.},

To prevent such situations and facilitate appropriate antibiotic prescribing, we designed and developed an asynchronous collaborative visual analytics tool. It visualizes the antibiotics' coverage spectrum that allows users choose the most appropriate antibiotics. The asynchronous collaboration around visualization mimics the actual collaboration scenarios in clinical settings, and provides supportive information during physician's decision-making process. Our work contributes to the CSCW community by providing a design prototype to support asynchronous collaboration among healthcare professionals, which is crucial but lacks in many of the present clinical decision support systems.},
